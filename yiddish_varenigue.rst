Yiddish varenigue
=================

**Dough**

  4 cups of flower
  
  1 dessert spoon of butter
  
  1 egg
  
  ½ glass warm water
  
  a pinch of salt

Mix flower and butter by hand until the dough is smooth. Add the egg and mix. Dissolve the salt into the warm water and slowly poor it on the dough. Work dough thoroughly and spread it in a thin layer.

**Filling**

  ½ kg ricotta
  
  2 egg yolks
  
  a pinch of salt
  
  a pinch of sugar
  
  cream

Mix the ricotta, egg yolks, salt and sugar and mash it with a fork. Add just enough cream to make this mixture stick

**Serving**

Cut up the dough in circles or squares of about 8 cm diameter. Add a spoonful of filling to each piece of dough, fold it over and seal the edges by pressing with a fork on both sides. Boil them briefly.

Place the varenigue on a baking tray, cover them with cream and small pieces of butter. Cover the tray with tinfoil (?) and take it to the oven (temp? time?). After the tray is thoroughly boiling, remove the foil (?) and finish cooking (?).
