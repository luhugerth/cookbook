Cheese bread
===========================

(about 20 medium units)

Ingredients
-----------

* 500 g manioc starch (may be replaced by corn startch, but results are inferior; potato starch gives a strong potato taste)
* 200 mL boiled water
* 200 mL milk
* 120 mL cooking oil
* 2 eggs
* 100 g salty hard grated cheese (meia-cura, parmesan, grana paddano)
* salt to taste

Procedure
---------
Pre-heat oven to 180Â°C.

Boil the water, milk and oil until they're well mix, then poor over the starch. Mix it as far as possible with a fork.

Add the eggs. Once the mixture is cool enough to touch, work in the cheese into the dough.

Make balls of the desired size and place them on a baking tray. Leave at least half a ball's size of space between them, as they will grow.

Bake for about 35'.
