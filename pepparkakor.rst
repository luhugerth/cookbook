Swedish crisp gingerbread and frosting
--------------------------------------

Dough
-----

  - 150 g butter
  - 180 mL light syrup
  - 360 mL sugar
  - 180 mL cream
  - Up to 4 cups of flour
  - 1/2 tbsp baking soda
  - 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon
  - 1/2 tbsp ground ginger
  - 1/2 tbsp ground cloves
  
Preparation
-----------

  - Mix the butter, the flour and the spices.
  - Whip the cream slightly and gently add it to the mixture.
  - Mix half the flower with the baking soda and gradually add it to the mixture.
  - Add more flour and work the dough until it's smooth, but not hard.
  - Let the dough rest until the next day.
  - Open the dough with a rolling pin. Add flour under and over it to prevent it from sticking.
  - Cut it with cookie cutters and bake it briefly at 175Â°C. They will still be slightly soft when coming out of the oven.
  
Frosting
--------

  Mix one egg white to ~400 mL confectionary sugar; add sugar and beat with a fork until the desired consistency is attained. Add 1 tsp 12% vinegar or lime juice to prevent yellowing. Put the frosting in a plastic bag and cut a whole of appropriate size on a corner to apply it to the cookies.
